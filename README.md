# RoleBaseAuthentication
This project implements role-based authentication to secure admin routes in a web application, ensuring that only users with the proper roles, like "Admin," can access sensitive or restricted routes. Role-based authentication (RBA) helps manage access by assigning users specific roles, each granting different permissions within the application.
